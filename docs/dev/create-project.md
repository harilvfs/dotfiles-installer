# Create a .dotinst for your project

Now it's time to create a `.dotinst` file for your project. This `.dotinst` will be configured for your development workflow. Add DEV to your configuration name to make sure that it's a Dev configuration.

Please use the following format for your id:

```sh
com.yourname.dotfilesname
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid using spaces in your dotfiles ID.

Click on "Save As" and save your configuration into the dev folder of your project directory.

Then install your dev configuration by loading the new local `.dotinst` file. Enter the path into the Load configuration entry field:

```sh
Projects/yourdotfiles/dev/com.your.dotfiles
```
Run the installation to activate your development configuration.
