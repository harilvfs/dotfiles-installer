# Overview for Developers

The Dotfiles Installer is designed to support you as a dotfiles developer, streamlining your workflow from testing to distribution. It integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing you to host your dotfiles in GitHub. You can quickly create a local installation and then sync your changes directly to the installation to test your dotfiles changes instantly. The installer also provides options to add settings for your dotfiles setup. When your configurations are complete, you can easily publish your dotfiles for everyone by generating a .dotinst file and hosting it on your server or GitHub.
