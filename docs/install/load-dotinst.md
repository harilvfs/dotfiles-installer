## Run the Setup Script

Dotfiles developers can include a setup script to install all dependencies for the dotfiles before installing them. If such a script is available, the Dotfiles Installer will asked how to proceed.

If the setup script doesn't support your distro, you can install all dependencies manually and skip the execution of the setup script.
