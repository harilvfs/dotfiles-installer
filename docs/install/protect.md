# Protect your Customization

Dotfiles are made to get customized to your individual needs. But the dotfiles distributor will publish updates frequently that will overwrite your customization.

In this dialog you can select parts of the configuration that you want to get protected in case of an update. For example select kitty, nvim, etc. to protect your individual setup.

Please note that protecting files can result in unwanted side effects and incompatibility compared to the original code.
